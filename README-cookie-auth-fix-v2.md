# Supabase Cookie Authentication Fix V2

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing issues with Supabase authentication cookies, resulting in the following error:

```
Failed to parse cookie string: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'b', "base64-eyJ"... is not valid JSON
```

This occurred when Supabase stored cookies with a `base64-` prefix that the default JSON parser couldn't handle properly.

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive solution with three parts:

### 1. Custom Auth Adapter

Created a custom authentication adapter (`app/lib/custom-auth-adapter.ts`) that:
- Wraps the cookie getter/setter to properly decode `base64-` prefixed cookies
- Provides enhanced logging for debugging cookie issues
- Exports a `createCustomServerComponentClient()` function as a drop-in replacement

### 2. Monkey Patch for Core Libraries

Added a monkey patch (`app/lib/auth-helpers-patch.ts`) that:
- Intercepts and replaces the `parseSupabaseCookie` function from `@supabase/auth-helpers-shared`
- Detects base64-encoded cookies and decodes them before parsing
- Preserves backward compatibility with regular JSON cookies

### 3. Updated Supabase Dependencies

Updated the Supabase packages to their latest compatible versions:
- @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs: ^0.10.0 (kept at current version)
- @supabase/ssr: ^0.6.1 (kept at current version)
- @supabase/supabase-js: ^2.49.4 (updated from ^2.39.3)

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/settings/route.ts`: 
   - Added enhanced logging
   - Switched to custom adapter for cookie handling
   - Properly inspects auth cookies for debugging

2. `app/lib/server-supabase.ts`:
   - Updated to use our custom adapter for all auth operations
   - Enhanced functions like `getSupabaseAppSettings` to handle base64 cookies

3. Added new files:
   - `app/lib/custom-auth-adapter.ts`: Our custom adapter implementation
   - `app/lib/auth-helpers-patch.ts`: Monkey patch for the core library

4. `package.json`:
   - Updated Supabase dependencies

## How to Test

1. Visit `/cookie-debug` to inspect cookies and verify decoding works
2. Login/logout to confirm authentication works consistently
3. Access authenticated routes to ensure they correctly recognize the session
4. Check user settings to confirm they load properly

## Additional Notes

- This fix avoids directly modifying node_modules, using dynamic imports instead
- Custom adapter provides fallbacks if decoding fails
- Enhanced logging has been added across the auth flow to facilitate future debugging
