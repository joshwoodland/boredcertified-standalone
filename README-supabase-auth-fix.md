# Supabase Authentication Fix

## Problem Summary

We identified an issue with Supabase authentication where API routes were creating a server-side Supabase client with cookies but then calling functions that used a different Supabase client instance that did not have access to those cookies. This resulted in authentication failures in API routes despite users being logged in on the client side.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Consolidated Supabase Client Creation

We refactored `app/lib/supabase.ts` to provide a consistent approach to Supabase client creation:

- Added a dedicated `createServerComponentSupabaseClient` function that properly handles cookies
- Kept the existing `supabase` singleton for client-side and legacy code
- Added an `createAdminSupabaseClient` function for admin operations with the service role key

### 2. Updated API Routes

Multiple API routes were updated to use the consistent pattern:

- `app/api/settings/route.ts` - Now uses the server component client with cookies
- `app/api/patients/route.ts` - Now uses the server component client with cookies

### 3. Updated Middleware

We enhanced the middleware to use Supabase's official `createMiddlewareClient` function, which properly handles authentication and session refreshing.

### 4. Added Testing Tools

We created tools to verify the authentication works properly:

- API endpoint: `/api/auth-test/supabase-client`
- Test page: `/auth-test/supabase-client`

## How to Test the Fix

1. Navigate to the test page at `/auth-test/supabase-client`
2. Verify that both client-side and server-side authentication are working
3. Test the protected API routes (settings, patients)

## Verification Steps

- [ ] User session is properly detected on the client side
- [ ] Server-side API routes can access the user session via cookies
- [ ] User-specific settings are loaded correctly
- [ ] Patient data is filtered by provider email correctly

## Implementation Pattern for Future API Routes

```typescript
// In your API route
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { createServerComponentSupabaseClient } from '@/app/lib/supabase';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // Create a Supabase client with cookie handling
  const cookieStore = cookies();
  const supabaseServer = createServerComponentSupabaseClient(() => cookieStore);
  
  // Get user session
  const { data: { session } } = await supabaseServer.auth.getSession();
  
  // Use the same client for subsequent operations
  const { data, error } = await supabaseServer
    .from('your_table')
    .select('*');
    
  // Handle the response
}
```

## Important Notes

- Always use the same Supabase client instance throughout an API route
- Never mix different client creation methods in the same request flow
- Remember that middleware and API routes need different client initialization
- Client-side components should use the browser client
