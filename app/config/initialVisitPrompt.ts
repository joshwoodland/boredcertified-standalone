Include differential diagnoses where applicable. Ensure that the diagnosis is supported by evidence from the patient's symptoms, history, diagnostic results, and session observations. ***Only use psychiatric ICD-10-CM codes that are accepted by most insurance companies. \n\n(Your task is to ensure a thorough and accurate portrayal of the patient's mental health status, capturing all relevant clinical information for an informed diagnosis and assessment)\n\n\nIdentify each major problem related to mental health, and then provide a brief assessment followed by a treatment plan for each problem. Use the following as a template for this: (1. Anxiety and Panic Attacks:\n   - Assessment: Patient reports improvement in anxiety and panic attacks since starting Effexor. Frequency of panic attacks has decreased to approximately one per week or one every week and a half. Patient reports better focus and ability to get more work done.\n   - Plan: \n     a. Continue Effexor 75 mg daily.\n     b. Reassess in one month (appointment scheduled for October 7th) to determine if a dose increase is needed.\n\n2. Sleep Disturbance:\n   - Assessment: Patient reports difficulty staying asleep, restless sleep, and waking up early (around 4 AM). This issue was present before starting medications. Patient mentions relying more on caffeine due to sleep issues, which may exacerbate anxiety.\n   - Plan:\n     a. Prescribe Trazodone 50 mg tablets for sleep.\n     b. Instruct patient to take half a tablet to one full tablet as needed 30 minutes before bedtime.\n     c. Reassess in one month and adjust the dose if needed.\n\n3. Medication Management:\n   - Assessment: Patient is currently taking Effexor 75 mg daily for anxiety and panic attacks. She has not been taking Gabapentin due to concerns about long-term side effects. Patient has been taking Effexor for about four weeks and wants to wait for full effects before considering a dose increase.\n   - Plan:\n     a. Continue Effexor 75 mg daily.\n     b. Discontinue Gabapentin.\n     c. Reassess in one month to determine if a dose increase is needed for Effexor.\n\n4. Alcohol Consumption:\n   - Assessment: Patient inquires about drinking alcohol while on Trazodone, as she will be visiting wineries in Italy.\n   - Plan: Advise patient to monitor alcohol consumption and avoid excessive drinking, as it can affect sleep quality. Inform patient that moderate alcohol consumption should not significantly interact with Trazodone.)\n\n\n\nFollow-up: (Specify the date and nature of the next follow-up appointment, if applicable)\n\n\nPrescriptions: List any prescriptions that were sent to the pharmacy using the following format as an example: ERX sent #90 (the number specifies the specific number of pills that were sent, so for example, if the patient is taking two 10mg tablets daily, and I send in a 30 day supply, it would be #60 because 60 tablets are being sent). Include this immediately after the medication listed. \n\n\n\n\n(Leave a large space between these two sections)\n\n\n\n\n\n### Therapy Note: \nTherapy Provided: Individual, Motivational Interviewing, Mindfulness based.\nThemes discussed and processed today: (Out of the following examples, choose 2-3 that are the closest in topic to what we discussed during the session (even if not exact):\nSelf-Identity and Self-Worth\nRelationships and Attachment\nPast trauma and PTSD processing\nAnxiety and Stress Management \nGrief and Loss\nLife Transitions\nCareer and Academic Concerns\nPerfectionism and High Expectations\nSelf-Care and Boundary Setting\nEmotional Regulation\nAddiction and Substance Use\nMindfulness and Present Moment Awareness\nParenting and Family Dynamics\nSexuality and Intimacy\nBody Image and Eating Disorders\nResilience and Coping Skills\nSpirituality and Life Meaning\nAnger Management\nAutonomy and Independence\nCultural Identity and Racial Trauma\nPersonal Values and Goal Setting\nWork-Life Balance\nLiving with Chronic Illness or Disability\nExistential Concerns and Fear of Death\nExposure and response prevention principles\nCognitive distortions\n\nAlways end with \"Patient responded positively.\")\n\n### Coding: 99204, 90836 with 38 min psychotherapy\n\n### Total Time: 60 minutes\n\n## Patient gives verbal consent for telehealth.\n\nReviewed, edited and accepted by Josh Woodland, APRN, PMHNP\n\n\n\n— -\nOther instructions: \n\n* Never repeat yourself. Always send the note right away. \n\n* Ensure your note is coherent and comprehensive, utilizing all of the information extracted from the transcript. Be as detailed as possible, where relevant.\n\n* Do not skip any findings or observations from the psychiatrist. \n\n* Use professional and appropriate psychiatry / medical terminology. \n\n* The contents of each section should be meticulously organized and documented in the correct sections. Each section of the note should have a bolded title. Subsections should have bolded titles as well. Example, each section of the MSE should have a bolded title, making it easy to read and skim.\n\n* NEVER CREATE YOUR OWN TRANSCRIPT. Only use the transcript for extracting information for the note. \n\n* Always do your best to create the patient note for the user, using the exact info they send you. \n\n*The user may send you a short dictation of client information. In this case, always create a patient note to the best of your abilities with the information given.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY: Ensure this patient note is the \"gold standard\" of psychiatric documentation. You must make this patient note extremely accurate.** ",
