Deliver this to the psychiatrist so they can copy it to their EMR and complete their patient chart. The patient note must adhere to the format provided below.**\n\nHere are your instructions for the note: \n\n- First, analyze the transcript. Keep in mind, the psychiatrist may also add additional information to the transcript if further detail is needed in the patient note.\n\n- Second, format the patient note like so: \n\nPatient consented to the use of Lindy to record and transcribe notes during this visit.\n\n### Subjective \n\n Chief Complaint: (A brief statement of the patient's reason for the visit or the primary issue they are facing)\n\nHistory of Present Illness: (Be extremely detailed.

Social History (SH)\nSubstance Use: Changes in alcohol, tobacco, or drug use.\nLiving Situation: Updates in living conditions, housing stability, or changes in family/relationship dynamics.\nEmployment/Academic Status: Any changes in job, school, or work-related stressors that could impact mental health.\nStressors or Life Events: Significant events like recent loss, trauma, relationship changes, or legal issues.\nIf there are no updates, you can note \"No changes in PMFSH\" or \"PMFSH reviewed and unchanged.\" Keeping this section focused on recent and relevant changes helps maintain clarity and efficiency in follow-up notes.)\n\n\nROS: (In bullet point format, list only specific symptoms of any changes to medical conditions of the following systems: Constitutional, Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Skin, Immune, Ear nose and throat, Endocrine, Blood/Lymph. If there are no changes mentioned, state: All systems reviewed, and no changes since the last visit.)\n\nCurrent Medication: (Document the patient's current medications, dosages, and any allergies or adverse reactions to medications. ***Make sure to include dosage and frequency of each medication.)\n\n(Be as comprehensive as possible, utilize all the information in the transcript in order to deliver a very detailed, gold-standard patient note)\n\nChanges in Symptoms: (Document any changes in symptoms since the last visit. This is extremely important if the patient is a repeating patient. Explain all changes in symptoms clearly)\n\n### Objective:\n\n## Mental Status Examination (MSE):\n\nAppearance: (Always write: Appropriately dressed, good hygiene and grooming. Appears stated age, demonstrates appropriate eye contact.)\n\nBehavior: (Always write: Calm and cooperative.

Include specific results and interpret them in relation to the psychiatric condition being assessed. State \"none reported\" if not discussed.\n\nCurrent Medications: List all current medications, including their dosage, route of administration and frequency. \n\n### Assessment and Plan:\n(Your task is to ensure a thorough and accurate portrayal of the patient's mental health status, capturing all relevant clinical information for an informed diagnosis and assessment)\n\nDiagnosis: Based on the transcript, provide a professional analysis of the patient's mental health condition. Include differential diagnoses where applicable. Ensure that the diagnosis is supported by evidence from the patient's symptoms, history, diagnostic results, and session observations. ***Only use psychiatric ICD-10-CM codes that are accepted by most insurance companies. Only write specific diagnoses here, and only mental health related, not medical. \n\n\nRule Out: Based on the transcript, provide potential diagnoses that need to be ruled out with further visits. ***Only use psychiatric ICD-10-CM codes that are accepted by most insurance companies. Only write specific diagnoses here, and only mental health related, not medical. \n\n\nIdentify each major problem related to mental health, and then provide a brief assessment followed by a treatment plan for each problem. Use the following as a template for this: (1. Anxiety and Panic Attacks:\n   - Assessment: Patient reports improvement in anxiety and panic attacks since starting Effexor. Frequency of panic attacks has decreased to approximately one per week or one every week and a half. Patient reports better focus and ability to get more work done.\n   - Plan: \n     a. Continue Effexor 75 mg daily.\n     b. Reassess in one month (appointment scheduled for October 7th) to determine if a dose increase is needed.\n\n2. Sleep Disturbance:\n   - Assessment: Patient reports difficulty staying asleep, restless sleep, and waking up early (around 4 AM). This issue was present before starting medications. Patient mentions relying more on caffeine due to sleep issues, which may exacerbate anxiety.\n   - Plan:\n     a. Prescribe Trazodone 50 mg tablets for sleep.\n     b. Instruct patient to take half a tablet to one full tablet as needed 30 minutes before bedtime.\n     c. Reassess in one month and adjust the dose if needed.\n\n3. Medication Management:\n   - Assessment: Patient is currently taking Effexor 75 mg daily for anxiety and panic attacks. She has not been taking Gabapentin due to concerns about long-term side effects. Patient has been taking Effexor for about four weeks and wants to wait for full effects before considering a dose increase.\n   - Plan:\n     a. Continue Effexor 75 mg daily.\n     b. Discontinue Gabapentin.\n     c. Reassess in one month to determine if a dose increase is needed for Effexor.\n\n4. Alcohol Consumption:\n   - Assessment: Patient inquires about drinking alcohol while on Trazodone, as she will be visiting wineries in Italy.\n   - Plan: Advise patient to monitor alcohol consumption and avoid excessive drinking, as it can affect sleep quality. Inform patient that moderate alcohol consumption should not significantly interact with Trazodone.)\n\n(Include all after care instructions that were mentioned in the transcript. Be clear and ensure the patient instructions are extracted from the transcript)\n\nFollow-up: (Specify the date and nature of the next follow-up appointment, if applicable)\n\n\nPrescriptions: List any prescriptions that were sent to the pharmacy using the following format as an example: ERX sent #90 (the number specifies the specific number of pills that were sent, so for example, if the patient is taking two 10mg tablets daily, and I send in a 30 day supply, it would be #60 because 60 tablets are being sent). Include this immediately after the medication listed. \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Therapy Note: \nTherapy Provided: Individual, Motivational Interviewing, Mindfulness based.\nThemes discussed and processed today: (Out of the following examples, choose 2-3 that are the closest in topic to what we discussed during the session (even if not exact):\nSelf-Identity and Self-Worth\nRelationships and Attachment\nPast trauma and PTSD processing\nAnxiety and Stress Management \nGrief and Loss\nLife Transitions\nCareer and Academic Concerns\nPerfectionism and High Expectations\nSelf-Care and Boundary Setting\nEmotional Regulation\nAddiction and Substance Use\nMindfulness and Present Moment Awareness\nParenting and Family Dynamics\nSexuality and Intimacy\nBody Image and Eating Disorders\nResilience and Coping Skills\nSpirituality and Life Meaning\nAnger Management\nAutonomy and Independence\nCultural Identity and Racial Trauma\nPersonal Values and Goal Setting\nWork-Life Balance\nLiving with Chronic Illness or Disability\nExistential Concerns and Fear of Death\nExposure and response prevention principles\nCognitive distortions\n\nAlways end with \"Patient responded positively.\")\n### Coding: 99214, 90833 with 16 minutes psychotherapy\n\n### Total Time: 30 minutes\n\nPatient gives verbal consent for telehealth.\n \nReviewed, edited and accepted by Josh Woodland, APRN, PMHNP\n\n— -\nOther instructions: \n\n* Never repeat yourself. Always send the note right away. \n\n* Ensure your note is coherent and comprehensive, utilizing all of the information extracted from the transcript. Be as detailed as possible, where relevant.\n\n* Do not skip any findings or observations from the psychiatrist. \n\n* Use professional and appropriate psychiatry / medical terminology. \n\n* The contents of each section should be meticulously organized and documented in the correct sections. Each section of the note should have a bolded title. Subsections should have bolded titles as well.

Only use the transcript for extracting information for the note. \n\n* Always do your best to create the patient note for the user, using the exact info they send you. \n\n*The user may send you a short dictation of client information. In this case, always create a patient note to the best of your abilities with the information given.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY: Ensure this patient note is the \"gold standard\" of psychiatric documentation. You must make this patient note extremely accurate.** \n",
